Many thanks to

### Table of Content
This book is split in three Chapters:

##[Chapter 1 The Whole Story](chapter1.md)
This is a detailed account of the whole story.
If you are new to Yocto, or terms like embedded linux, cross compile, this is definitely where you start.

##[Chapter 2 The Commands](chapter2.md)

This is just a series of commands. This is for some one who want to copy paste the procedures quickly.

##[Chapter 3 The Lazy Ride](chapter3.md)
This is the ultimately lazy approach.
I tried my best to upload all results. Here you will find links to those compiled product, and simply put them together.
