### Special thanks
Many thanks to
Professor [Ling-Jyh Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/cclljj/) for bringing me into this new research field and giving me much support and resource.

Professor [Ying-ping Chen](http://ypchen.tw) (now a co-author of this book), who supported my projects and discussed with me various problems along the way.

Also to my friend Tock Chiu, who doesn't have a personal website yet but is an expert on compiler. And to Anthony Liu, an active member in Taiwan's embedded community, who taught me many concepts at the instruction level debugging.

Without you, this manual is not possible.
