### Special thanks
Many thanks to
Professor [Ling-Jyh Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/cclljj/), for bringing me into this new research field and give me much support and resources.

Professor [Ying-ping Chen](http://ypchen.tw) (now co-author of the book) who supported my projects and discussed with me various problems along the way.

Also to my friend Tock Chiu, who don't have a personal website yet, but is an expert on compiler. And to Anthony Liu, an active member in Taiwan's embedded community, who taught me many concepts in instruction level debugging.

Without you, this manual is not possible.

### Table of Content
You don't need to read the whole book, just choose one of the chapters that is best for you:

[Chapter 1 The Whole Story](chapter1.md)
This is a detailed account of the whole story.
If you are new to Yocto, or terms like embedded linux, cross compile, this is definitely where you start.

[Chapter 2 The Commands](chapter2.md)
This is just a series of commands. This is for some one who want to copy paste the procedures quickly.

[Chapter 3 All In One](chapter3.md)
This is the ultimately lazy approach.
I tried my best to upload all results. Here you will find links to those compiled product, and simply put them together.
